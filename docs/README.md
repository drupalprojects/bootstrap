## Terminology

The term **"bootstrap"** can be used excessively through out this project's
documentation. For clarity, we will always attempt to use this word verbosely
in one of the following ways:

- **[Drupal Bootstrap]** refers to the Drupal base theme project.
- **[Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)** refers to the external
  front end framework.
- **[drupal_bootstrap](https://api.drupal.org/apis/drupal_bootstrap)** refers
  to Drupal's bootstrapping process or phase.
  
When referring to files inside the [Drupal Bootstrap] project directory, they
will always start with `./bootstrap` and continue to specify the full path to
the file or directory inside it. For example, the file that is responsible for
displaying the text on this page is located at `./bootstrap/docs/README.md`.

When referring to files inside a sub-theme, they will always start with
`./subtheme/` and continue to specify the full path to the file or directory
inside it. For example, the primary file Drupal uses to determine if a theme
exists is: `./subtheme/subtheme.info`, where `subtheme` is the machine name of
your sub-theme.
